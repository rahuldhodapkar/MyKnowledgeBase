## sensory neurons
- Also called "afferent neurons"
- Transmit info from *receptors* -> *spinal cord + brain*

## motor neurons
- Also called "efferent neurons"
- Transmit info from *spinal cord + brain* -> *muscles + glands*
- NOTE that glands also count as "motor neurons"

## interneurons
- Found between other neurons.
- Most numerous basic type of neuron.
- Located predominantly in brain and spinal cord

## reflex arcs
- Neural circuits controlling reflexive behavior
- Bypass conscious control
- Often work in conjunction with pain-driven conscious processes
  that continue after the reflex arc has driven a relevant behavior
        **(e.g. you feel pain after touching a hot stove, after
                reflex has caused you to withdraw your hand)**

## central nervous system
- Brain and spinal cord
- Also includes the olfactory and optic nerves

## peripheral nervous system
- Anything that is not the CNS (tongue in cheek)
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves and 10-12 pairs of cranial nerves
- Can be subdivided into the *somatic* and *autonomic* nervous systems

## somatic nervous system
- also known as the "voluntary" nervous system
- comprised of afferent and efferent nerve fibers
- sensory and motor neurons distributed throughout the skin, joints, 
  and muscles

## autonomic nervous system
- regulates heartbeat, respiration, digestion, and glandular secretion,
  as well as temperature control
- outside of conscious control
- autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the *sympathetic*
  and *parasympathetic* neverous system.

## Forebrain
*known as the "prosencephalon"*

Differentiates into:
- Cerebral cortex (complex perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral processes)
- Basal ganglia (balance and coordination in movement)
- Limbic system (emotion and memory)
- Thalamus (sensory relay station)
- Hypothalamus (hunger and thirst; emotion)

## Midbrain
*known as the "mesencephalon"*

Differentiates into:
- Inferior and superior colliculi (sensorimotor reflexes)

## Hindbrain
*known as the "rhombencephalon"*

Differentiates into:
- Cerebellum (Refined motor movements)
- Medulla oblongata (Vital functioning [breathing, digestion])
- Reticular formation (arousal and alertness)
